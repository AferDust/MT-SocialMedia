# Multi Threading Social Media - SKYNET 

## Description

This project demonstrates a client-server application using Java. It includes a server component that listens for client connections to perform various operations based on client requests, and a client component that connects to the server to send requests and receive responses. The implementation showcases basic networking concepts in Java.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:
- Java Development Kit (JDK), version 17 or higher. Ensure Java is properly installed on your system and the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set.

## Project Structure

- `src/sample`: Contains the Java source files.
    - `Client.java`: Implements the client-side application.
    - `Server.java`: Implements the server-side application.
    - Other Java classes utilized in the project.

## Setup

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Open Command Prompt (CMD). Change directory to the root of your projectâ€™s src folder
    ```sh
   cd path\to\your\project\src

3. Compile all Java files in the sample package:
    ```sh
   javac sample/*.java
   
4. From the same src directory in CMD, run the server:
   ```sh
   First run server: java sample.Server
   Then run client: java sample.Client
   ```
